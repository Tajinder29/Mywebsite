<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p> paneer and tofu are different foods. Paneer is a cheese, while tofu is made from soy. However, they're both vegetarian sources of protein and calcium that have mild tastes and fairly soft textures. </p>
<b><i><h1>Ingredients</h1></i></b>
<ul>
    <li>225 grams paneer cut in cubes</li>
    <li>1 capsicum/bell pepper, cut in cubes</li>
    <li>   1 onion large, cut in cubes</li>
    <li>   4-5 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
   <li>     1 tablespoon ginger, finely chopped</li>
   <li> 2 green chilies, slitted</li>
    <li>    Black pepper powder, to taste</li>

 <li> 1-2 tablespoons chopped green onions (green part only)</li>
</ul>
<p><h1>Preparation Steps :</h1></p>
<ol>
    <li>Boil 2 cups of water and add paneer cubes in it. This will make paneer soft. Drain water and keep asid.</li>
    <li>Mix 4 tablespoons of water in cornflour and keep it aside. Heat oil in a pan or wok. When oil gets very hot add garlic and ginger. Saute for 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add slit green chilies and chopped onion. Saute for 10 seconds.</li>
    <li>Next throw in chopped capsicum. Sauté for 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> Add salt, sugar, black pepper, soya sauce, chili sauce, lemon juice, and cornflour mixture. Cook it for 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> Throw in paneer cubes. Mix well so that paneer cubes are coated well with spices and sauce. Keep it covered for 1 minute.</li>
    <li> Check salt and heat levels. Adjust if needed. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve. Be mindful of the salt because the soya sauce also contains sodium.</li>
